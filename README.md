# FGC Scoreboard
FGC Scoreboard is an html and css scoreboard for fighting game tournament streams. It uses absolutely no images (except for tournament/company logos) and absolutely no webm files for animations.

## How FGC Scoreboard Works
To get started with FGC Scoreboard just open your streaming platform of choice, add a **broswer source**, and then navigate to wherever you saved the **scoreboard.html** file.

The scoreboard is built to work with StreamControl (included in the repo). All of your data entry should happen through that app including:
* Player Names
* Team Names
* Round
* Score
* Game

To change any of the colors, the font, etc. just open the scss file and tweak the variables at the top. There's no need to jump into the rest of the styling unless you want to change something more drastic.

Finally, when you select a game (and hit save) the layout will adjust so that the scores and logos don't cover important guages.

## Thank You
Massive thank you to TheSassageKing for making the initial [4 hour YouTube tutorial this is based on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqyFknxaVWo). The general look of the board and a good chunk of the code's skeleton comes from following that video.

Also, thank you to [u/Brylark](https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/g0747t/valorant_font/) over on Reddit for making the VALORANT font that I've included in the repo and plan to use myself for the time being.
