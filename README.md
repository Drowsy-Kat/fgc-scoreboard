# FGC Scoreboard
FGC Scoreboard is an html and css scoreboard for fighting game tournament streams. It uses absolutely no images (except for tournament/company logos) and absolutely no webm files for animations.

## How FGC Scoreboard Works
To get started with FGC Scoreboard just open your streaming platform of choice, add a **broswer source**, and then navigate to wherever you saved the **scoreboard.html** file.

The scoreboard is built to work with StreamControl (included in the repo). All of your data entry should happen through that app including:
* Player Names
* Team Names
* Round
* Score
* Game

When you select a game (and hit save) the layout will adjust so that the scores and logos don't cover important guages.
